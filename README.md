## AI Video Analysis

The core intelligence of dYm — automatically understand what's in your videos without watching them one by one.

### How It Works

1. **Frame Extraction** — FFmpeg extracts key frames from videos at configurable intervals (e.g., 4 evenly-spaced frames from a 30s video)
2. **Vision API Analysis** — Extracted frames are sent to a multimodal Vision LLM (OpenAI-compatible API) for content understanding
3. **Structured Output** — The AI returns structured metadata that gets stored alongside each video in the local database

### What the AI Extracts

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Tags** | Content keywords for search & filtering | `["cooking", "recipe", "pasta"]` |
| **Category** | Content classification | `Food & Cooking` |
| **Summary** | Brief description of the video content | `Step-by-step pasta carbonara recipe with tips` |
| **Scene** | Visual scene description | `Kitchen, indoor, close-up shots` |
| **Content Level** | Content rating (1-5 scale) | `1` (safe for all audiences) |

### Analysis Configuration

- **Model Selection** — Works with any OpenAI-compatible Vision API (Grok, OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, etc.)
- **Custom Prompts** — Define exactly what the AI should look for in your content
- **Frame Slicing** — Configure how many frames to extract per video (trade-off between accuracy and API cost)
- **Concurrency Control** — Run multiple analyses in parallel with configurable worker count
- **Rate Limiting** — Built-in RPM (requests per minute) limiter to stay within API quotas
- **Batch Processing** — Analyze all unprocessed videos in one click, with real-time progress tracking
- **Per-User Analysis** — Analyze videos from a specific creator, or across all creators at once

### Image Post Support

For image carousel posts (Douyin's photo mode), dYm sends the original images directly to the Vision API — no frame extraction needed. Up to 10 images per post are analyzed in a single API call.
